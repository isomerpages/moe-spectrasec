<p align="justify">In March 2020, MOE announced that all Secondary School Students will embark on the&nbsp;<b>NDLP</b>&nbsp;(<b>National Digital Literacy Programme</b>). The NDLP will enable all students to own a digital learning device that enables them to be self-directed in their learning and explore their interests during HBL (home-based learning). In June 2020, then Minister of Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung announced that the NDLP will be brought forward to 2021. Hence all Secondary School students will own a personalised device for personalised learning by the end of 2021.</p>

##### **Funding for Students**

<p align="justify">The cost of the device bundle can be paid using the&nbsp;<b>Student’s Edusave</b>&nbsp;account, after setting aside a provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.</p>

<p align="justify">To ensure the affordability of devices, there was a one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020 to support the purchase of the device. This is on top of the annual $290 credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students.&nbsp;</p>

##### **Financial Assistance Support**

*   For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket (OOP) will be $0.
*   For students on non-MOE-FAS, subsidies are available such that the maximum OOP will be $50.
*   Financial assistance is also available for Permanent residents (PR) and International Students (IS) who need support.
