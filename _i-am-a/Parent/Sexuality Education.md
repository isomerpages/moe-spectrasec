<h4><strong>MOE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling
students to understand the physiological, social, and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships,
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <strong>Goals of Sexuality Education</strong> are
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that
are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family, and society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and
unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Overview of Spectra Secondary&nbsp;School’s&nbsp;Sexuality Education Programme for 2025</strong></h4>
<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner
through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped
into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships,
Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may
click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/sexuality-education/scope-and-teaching-approach" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include
Science and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Education</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Lessons</strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality
are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular
culture, and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the
adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles with
new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally from
15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between
physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency to act
on impulse, and experiment with various activities (including sexual activities),
sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise
from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly
strong, and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures
faced by middle adolescents from within themselves and from peers, it is
important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction, and
an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary
students will have the opportunity to develop positive self-esteem, develop
their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills
to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern
at this age.</p>

<h4><strong>eTeens Programme</strong>:</h4>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;eTeens is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board,
in collaboration with the Ministry of Education,&nbsp;<strong>for Secondary 3 students</strong>&nbsp;to
provide them with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from
a health perspective. eTeens is conducted in two segments: a mass talk
segment and a classroom-based programme.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp;Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness,
and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also
learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves
their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.
The desired outcome of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed, and sensible decisions.</p>
<p><strong>At Spectra Secondary School, the eTeens programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
