##### Our PSG

Parents are a very important part of the SPECTRA family. The SPECTRA <b>Parents Support Group (PSG)</b> was set up because we believe that both the parents and teachers have important and complementary roles to play in the upbringing of the children. Today, as children spend long hours in school for both academic and co-curricular activities, it is more crucial that parents partner the school in inculcating a common set of values in them.
	
	
##### Objectives

The SPECTRA PSG aims to:
+ create more opportunities for parents to acquire relevant knowledge and skills through the organization of workshops and seminars;
+ increase parent-child bonds through activities and camp; and
+ promote&nbsp;parental involvement in the schoolâ€™s programs by raising awareness of school events and activities to parents.
