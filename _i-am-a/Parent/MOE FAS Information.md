<h5><strong>💰 MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME (MOE FAS)</strong></h5>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) provides financial assistance to needy
Singaporean pupils in specialised schools. The application for financial
assistance for the year 2026 is now open, and parents/guardians may apply
online at <strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasss" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasss</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Key enhancements and provisions have been introduced for the 2026 MOE
FAS applications to streamline the application process and better support
families.</p>
<p>MOE will integrate HOMES for means-testing from the 2026 application cycle.
Once a parent/guardian applies for financial assistance via the link, the
system will automatically draw household income data from government sources,
removing the need for most applicants to submit supporting documents.</p>
<p>To expand access to financial assistance and provide better support to
families in need, the monthly gross household income ceiling for MOE FAS
will <strong>increase from $3,000 to $4,000</strong>, while the per capita
income ceiling will <strong>increase from $750 to $1,000</strong>. Students
under MOE FAS will also benefit from enhanced transport subsidies. The
monthly public transport subsidy for students taking public transport will <strong>increase from $17 to $21</strong>.</p>
<p>The enhancements are in addition to existing subsidies that remain for
school fees, textbooks, uniforms and meals.</p>
