<h5><strong>What Spectra Offers</strong></h5>
<p>Spectra Secondary School is a skills-focused specialized school. We admitted&nbsp;our
first batch of Secondary One students&nbsp;in January 2014. We provide
a customized and practice-oriented curriculum to suit the learning needs
of our students. We also work closely with the Institute of Technical Education
(ITE) and industry partners to develop programmes and attachment opportunities
for our students. ’Spectra’ represents the school’s philosophy of recognizing
the different spectrum of talents and strengths of our students. The School
aims to embrace and nurture our young in developing their strengths and
instilling self-confidence in all.</p>

<p>Previously, Spectra only admits students via direct admission. From 2023,
Spectra will take in additional students who are eligible for Posting Group
1 and applied via S1 Posting. This allows Spectra to take in more students,
e.g., those who have missed the direct application.</p>
