##### **What Spectra Offers**

<p align="justify">Spectra Secondary School is a skills-focused specialized school. We admitted&nbsp;our first batch of Secondary One students&nbsp;in January 2014. We will provide a customized and practice-oriented curriculum to suit the learning needs of our students. We will also work closely with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and industry partners to develop programmes and attachment opportunities for our students. ’Spectra’ represents the school’s philosophy of recognizing the different spectrum of talents and strengths of our students. The school aims to embrace and nurture our young in developing their strengths and instilling self-confidence in all.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="tg-r1gl">Previously, SPECTRA only admits students via direct admission. This year, SPECTRA will be able to take in additional students who are eligible for Posting Group 1 and applied via S1 Posting. This allows SPECTRA to take in more students, e.g., those who have missed the direct application.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-r1gl">As SPECTRA processed the applications via direct admission in 2022 and will continue to admit students via hybrid application modes from 2023 onwards, it would not be meaningful to display the PSLE score range like other secondary schools where the PSLE score range is derived solely based on Sec 1 Posting.</td>

    <td class="tg-5zdd">4)	I have applied directly to SPECTRA. Do I still need to take part in Sec 1 Posting to select other schools?</td>

    <td class="tg-r1gl">Students who apply directly to SPECTRA must still participate in Sec 1 Posting to indicate other school choices. This is to ensure that they are posted to a secondary school in case their application to SPECTRA is unsuccessful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-r1gl">Students whose SPECTRA application is successful will be informed by the respective school. The school choices that they have submitted during Sec 1 posting will be automatically voided.</td>
