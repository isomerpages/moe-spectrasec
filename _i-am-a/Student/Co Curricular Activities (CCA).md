<p align="justify">Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) is an important component of character education in Spectra Secondary School, and forms a part of the holistic, well-rounded education that we seek to provide our students.	

##### **Objectives of CCA**

* Opportunity to develop core attitudes, skills and knowledge (ASK) relative to their CCA, through authentic learning experiences.
* Platform for students to learn about themselves and others beyond the classroom.
* Platform to forge healthy friendships and team spirit.
* Opportunity to develop leisure and lifetime interests.

By participating in a CCA, students will be able to:
* Acquire new knowledge and talent areas.
* Develop their leadership capacity.
* Demonstrate school values and role model school outcomes.
* Improve emotional and physical well being.
* Learn valuable life skills.

***

##### CCA Policy
* It is mandatory for every student to participate in at least one CCA.
* Students must attend all CCA activities.
* Absence from CCA must be supported by medical certificates or parents’ letters, which must be submitted to the CCA teacher promptly.
* Every student is expected to be committed and contribute actively to his/ her CCA that he/ she has chosen.
* Students may seek approval from HOD PE and CCA to take up a second CCA in school.
