**Am I being cyber bullied? How do I deal with fake news is? Am I a social media addict?**  
If you have these questions, we are here to help you.  
First let us understand what is Cyber Wellness.

**What is Cyber Wellness?** 
<br>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.
