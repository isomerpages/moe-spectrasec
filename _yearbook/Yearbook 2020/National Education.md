National Education (NE) commemorative events form the cornerstone of Spectra Secondary School’s effort in cultivating a strong sense of belonging, commitment and rootedness towards Singapore among our students. This year, our events took a different shape as they were conducted online.

Nevertheless, the significance of these events were not lost among our students, as they learnt the importance of treasuring the peace and stability in Singapore during Total Defence Day (TDD), demonstrating sensitivity and appreciation towards the different races and religions in Singapore during Racial Harmony Day (RHD), as well as building cross-cultural skills and relationships with people from other countries during International Friendship Day (IFD).

##### **National Day Celebrations**

This year’s National Day began with an e-Parade, which culminated with the recitation of the Recollections in class. The Secondary 1 and 4 students designed mosaic art pieces on coasters to show our appreciation towards Singapore, while our Secondary 2 and 3 students played hosts to our Serving Learning partners by conducting interactive games and activities via online platforms. As a school, we also prepared Care Packs that were handed out to our various partners and migrant workers who have played a key role in our country’s nation-building.
