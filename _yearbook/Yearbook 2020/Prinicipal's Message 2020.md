**Principal’s Message – School Annual 2020**

It has been 9 months since the COVID-19 storm swept Singapore and the world. The collective response of Spectra staff, students and parents has been spectacular. As Singaporeans, we played our part to help our nation tide over this crisis.

I would like to say a special thank you to everyone for all the sacrifices made, and for always putting community before self. Without the combined efforts and sacrifices made by everyone, we would not be where we are today.  We must not let our guard down until the COVID-19 virus is completely contained.

Spectra made the best of the situation and grew as a school community despite this being an extremely challenging year. Fortunately our students were all equipped with a personal laptop so we could ensure continuity of learning during Home Based Learning.

I want to applaud Spectra staff for the massive effort in adapting, improvising, and producing interesting Zoom-based lessons to engage students despite trying circumstances. I must also applaud our staff who went out of their way to personally visit homes to ensure that every single student was safe and accounted for.

Spectra would also like to thank the following angels:

*   All the generous donors who provided us with additional face masks, face shields, hand sanitisers, thermal imagers, and monetary support for student meals; and
*   Every member of the School Board and Parent Support Group, and the Temasek Foundation for their strong support and generosity. Thank you very much!

When school finally reopened, lessons and activities had to be conducted differently, but this did not dampen the Spectra spirit. Time and again, the Spectra Kampong rose to the challenge and made the best of the circumstances. National Day was celebrated with gusto and enthusiasm, and Teachers’ Day was simply a blast.

I would also like to take this opportunity to offer my heartiest congratulations to the Secondary 4 cohort on your graduation today, and I wish you all the best going forward. I know that you have been shaped and fortified by the defining moments wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. You will grow further to become better, kinder and more compassionate persons in work and life. I believe you will go on to make Spectra very proud one day. When you face challenges in the future, always remember our School Motto, _Together We Can!_

We are indeed blessed and thankful that we have reached the last day of the School year in 2020 with everyone safe. Have a good and meaningful holiday, and I look forward to welcoming all of you back in 2021.

_Together We Can!_
