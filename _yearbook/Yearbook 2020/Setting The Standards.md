The Student Council&nbsp;had its first Investiture in 2016 when the Student Council was first set up.&nbsp;

In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 5th Student Council Investiture Ceremony was held over 3 days, from 14 to 16 July. In previous years, this momentous event was held in the school hall, in front an audience of excited students and eager parents. However, during this extraordinary time, teachers and councillors had to be creative to conduct this important ceremony in a unique yet memorable way.

Since a mass assembly was not allowed, the ceremony had to be held asynchronously in the classrooms during the Assembly Period&nbsp;of the week, which meant it had to take place on different days of the week. As such, all form teachers were roped in to conduct the ceremony.

Although the process this year had been challenging, the enthusiasm from the members made the process enjoyable and worthwhile.

This 2020 Student Council Investiture was challenging but nonetheless memorable!
