##### **Spectra’s Got Talent**

One of the most highly anticipated annual events, Spectra’s Got Talent had a twist this year due to COVID-19. The competition went fully online with the Finals being held on Teacher’s Day! Since July, audition videos were submitted and 4 videos were selected to enter the final rounds. The Wildcard round let more talents come forward. Eventually, a total of 6 videos made it to the final round.

The 6 finalists are Kaitlyn Ong (S4-4), Allyshah Binte Alias (S2-4), Nurin Lasyirah Binte Khairudin (S1-4), Nandhini d/o Durai (S2-4), Shervon Ng (S1-9), and Adrian Shukry (S2-3). Spectrans voted for their favorite talents through an online voting system at the finals.&nbsp;After a suspense-filled wait, the top 3 winners were announced by our Principal to roaring claps and cheers. The top 3 winners are Adrian Shukry (3rd position), Kaitlyn Ong (2nd position), and Nandhini d/o Durai (1st position).&nbsp;

Congratulations to all winners!
