Pandemic or not, Home-Based Learning (HBL) is an inevitable reality in today’s educational landscape. HBL allows teachers and students to leverage on technology which will enable learning accessibility more flexibly. This digital enabled learning experience will provide opportunities for an autonomous, self-directed learning to take place.

**HBL – From the Lenses of the Students**

Who says learning can’t be fun?

A light-hearted video to share how a typical day of Spectrans during HBL was like.

**HBL – English Lessons**

In school, we utilise the wide variety of physical books, newspapers and magazines found in our school library. During HBL, the EL teachers explored new ways to get our students interested in reading and build their confidence. We invited our students into the digital world of reading with e-books, videos, web articles and e-magazines found in digital libraries and websites. Storyline Online and Overdrive @NLB were a hit with our students!

**HBL – Math Lessons**

A Math lesson without the whiteboard or the visualiser? We too thought it was unimaginable until we discovered the Wacom tablet. The Wacom tablet simulated the writing Math teachers do on physical worksheets and whiteboards. Compatible with popular platforms like Word, PowerPoint and Paint, Wacom allowed us to effectively replace our traditional tools. The Wacom pen made the hassle of typing and inserting equations disappear too. With HBL, the digital Math classroom was born.

**HBL – PE Lessons**

Couldn’t lose sight of fitness during the Covid period, could we? The PE teachers devised a plan to make HBL PE lessons both about learning and maintaining fitness. Using Joe Wicks’ homed-based exercise videos and safety guidelines created by the teachers, Spectrans did workouts right in the convenience of their own homes. They filmed all of their workouts and each student produced a video montage capturing his or her progress over the 3 weeks. The teachers also used SLS to cover the PE SOW, providing students with links to discover more about Target Games like Darts, Indoor Bowling and Olympic Shooting.

**HBL – VE Lessons**

To bring Retail lessons to life, the teachers used different virtual backgrounds for different Retail lessons over Zoom. Spotlight was used to check for understanding and progress while Wacom was used to allow easy note-taking and going through of exercises during screen-sharing. Phase Test demonstrations were transformed into videos in SLS that could be re-watched at the convenience of the students. Students could listen to voice recordings and reply by recording their own responses!
