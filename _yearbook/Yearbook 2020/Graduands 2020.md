Dear Graduands,

It was not too long ago when you came to Spectra as a fresh Secondary One student.&nbsp; I wondered then, how you would be in 4 years.&nbsp; In a&nbsp;blink of an eye, you will be graduating.&nbsp;

In your final year in Spectra, apart from having to deal with the stress of the GCE N-Level examinations, you bravely navigated new ways of learning through Zoom, SLS and a whole host of other modes, gave up&nbsp;fun learning journeys, running freely around the school field, mingling with your friends, and swapped&nbsp;it for fixed seating and hand sanitizer. You showed us how resilient and adaptable you are, never complaining about the new ‘normal’ of school yet managing to have fun with life as we have come to know it.

My dear Secondary Fours, the corridors will never be the same&nbsp;without you.&nbsp; Your teachers and I will miss your chatter, jokes and greetings that we have become accustomed to over these four years.&nbsp; As you count down to the final days of your schooling life in Spectra, know that this is not a ‘Goodbye’ but&nbsp;‘Until we meet again’ moment. May your future be as bright as you hope it to be.&nbsp; May you always stay cheerful, find joy in the little things in life and somewhere, in the deep&nbsp;recesses of your heart, remember that you are loved dearly by&nbsp;us.&nbsp; Continue to be brave and pursue that dream of yours with great fervor and zest, no matter how difficult it may be.

With much love,

**Ms Germaine  
Secondary 4 Year Head**
