<h5><strong>Overview of Spectra Academy Programme</strong></h5>
<p>The Spectra Academy, launched in March 2023, is a 24-week work-study programme
to prepare post-secondary students for admission to the ITE. Targeted at
hands-on learners, this programme allows the students to deepen their career
interests through formal training in an ITE Skills Subject (ISS), and an
8-week work attachment. Currently, the three ISSs offered are <strong>Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations</strong>, <strong>Retail &amp; e-Commerce</strong> and <strong>Internet of Things Applications</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>Key Stages of the Programme</strong></h5>
<p>Upon successful enrolment, students will be engaged in an intensive orientation
programme in Stage 1 (Induction), before receiving the required training
in Stage 2 (Preparation). In Stage 3 (Work Attachment), students will be
attached to industry partners for work experience. In Stage 4, students
will return to the Spectra Academy for assessments and debrief, before
transiting to ITE / Work. Students will receive a stipend during their
work attachment. We provide financial assistance to students who need financial
help and bursaries.</p>
