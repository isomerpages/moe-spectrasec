##### **Overview of Spectra Academy Programme**

<p align="justify">The Spectra Academy, launched in March 2023, is a 24-week work-study programme to prepare post-secondary students for admission to the ITE. Targeted at hands-on leaners, this programme allows the students to deepen their career interests through formal training in an ITE Skills Subject (ISS), and a 10-week work attachment. Currently, the two ISS offered are: Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations and Retail &amp; e-Commerce.</p>
