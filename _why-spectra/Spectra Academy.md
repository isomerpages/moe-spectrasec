##### The Spectra Academy

Overview of Spectra Academy Programme
The Spectra Academy, launched in March 2023, is a 24-week work-study programme to prepare post-secondary students for admission to the ITE. Targeted at hands-on leaners, this programme allows the students to deepen their career interests through formal training in an ITE Skills Subject (ISS), and a 10-week work attachment. Currently, the two ISS offered are: Culinary & Restaurant Operations and Retail & e-Commerce.
