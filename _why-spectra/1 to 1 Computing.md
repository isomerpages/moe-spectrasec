<p align="justify">The Spectra 1-to-1 Computing Programme started its inception in 2014. It aims to support the&nbsp;Spectra Philosophy in Learning. In particular, the belief that every student learns at a different pace.</p>

<p align="justify">To enable this to happen, all students will need a laptop for their learning. This device can be used to access SLS, learning materials, instructional videos, self-assessed questions to attain mastery, and the Internet to pursue other areas of interest. These resources allow the teacher to assign differentiated instructions and work to different students, customised to their learning needs. More able students can thus move ahead while the weaker ones can spend more time practising to master the current chapter.</p>

<p align="justify">In March 2020, MOE announced that all Secondary School Students will embark on the&nbsp;<b>NDLP</b>&nbsp;(<b>National Digital Literacy Programme</b>). The NDLP will enable all students to own a digital learning device that enables them to be self-directed in their learning and explore their interests during HBL (home-based learning). In June 2020, then Minister of Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung announced that the NDLP will be brought forward to 2021. Hence all Secondary School students will own a personalised device for personalised learning by the end of 2021.</p>

##### **Funding for Students**

<p align="justify">The cost of the device bundle can be paid using the&nbsp;<b>Student’s Edusave</b>&nbsp;account, after setting aside a provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.</p>

<p align="justify">To ensure the affordability of devices, there was a one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020 to support the purchase of the device. This is on top of the annual $290 credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students.&nbsp;</p>

##### **Financial Assistance Support**

*   For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket (OOP) will be $0.
*   For students on non-MOE-FAS, subsidies are available such that the maximum OOP will be $50.
*   Financial assistance is also available for Permanent residents (PR) and International Students (IS) who need support.

<b> More information will be shared in January 2021, when MOE provides schools with more details.</b>
