##### Literacy, Numeracy and Behavioural Programme

At Spectra, we have a dedicated **Learning Support Unit** that coordinates programmes with a focus on providing literacy, numeracy and behavioural support via a **3-Tier System of Support**. We have committed coaches who provide customised specialist support for our Tier 3 students at the lower secondary levels.

**Our Literacy coaches** support students with language learning difficulties to access the Tier 1 main class curriculum by building their confidence and bridging their literacy skills gaps.

**Our Numeracy coaches** help students build confidence and strengthen their core Mathematical concepts through the use of manipulatives, games and online resources.

**Our Learning Behaviour Support coaches** support students in achieving better social, emotional, and academic outcomes through the Positive Behavioural Intervention Support (PBIS) approach and individualised behaviour intervention plans.

##### **Reading Programme**

At Spectra, we believe that reading is the key to increasing the literacy levels of our students. Reading programme is a **weekly school-wide platform** where students and teachers read and participate in reading-related activities.

This whole-school approach towards reading supports students in developing positive reading habits and discovering books that are of interest to them based on their respective reading levels. Students have access to the **Spectra Reading List** as well as **NLB Overdrive** for an extensive collection of reading materials.

Our English Language department also actively promotes reading among the students through monthly reading engagement sessions where the students have opportunities to hear from their fellow schoolmates as well as their teachers on recommended reads.

##### Volunteer Reading Programme

Besides Literacy coaches who work with our lower secondary students, we also have experienced volunteers who are retired English language teachers, literacy coaches or parents to support our Secondary Three students in small groups via face-to-face or online platforms. Our volunteers engage students in various reading and speaking activities to pique and further develop their confidence and interest in literacy.

With greater confidence and stronger literacy skills, students are more motivated to work towards their academic goals not just in the English Language but also in other subjects. The weekly programme supports students throughout the academic year including end-of-year examinations preparation and engagement during the holidays. 

We are very thankful for all the care and effort that our volunteers have put in to establish this programme and support our Secondary Three students this year. We hope to grow our team of volunteers and customise this programme further to meet the needs of our students.



##### Professional Development for Spectra Teachers

At Spectra, we believe that caring and skilful teachers are key in enabling students to build strong foundations in literacy and numeracy, sharpening their skills in vocational training and digital technology as well as nurturing independent and responsible citizens of good character.

We are committed to supporting our teachers in the continual development of competencies to respond to the changing and varied needs of our students. **Professional development at Spectra focuses on three key domains: The Skillful Teacher, Certification Training in Special Needs, and e-Pedagogy.**

Therefore, our teachers are able to foster stronger teacher-student relationships, and design and differentiate lessons through the use of digital technology and tiered approaches to tailor programmes for students with different learning needs.
