##### **Literacy, Numeracy and Behavioural Programme**

<p align="justify">At Spectra, we have a dedicated&nbsp;<b>Learning Support Unit</b>&nbsp;that coordinates programmes with a focus on providing literacy, numeracy and behavioural support via a&nbsp;3-Tier System of Support. We have committed coaches who provide customised specialist support for our Tier 3 students at the lower secondary levels.</p>

##### **Reading Programme**

<p></p><p align="justify">At Spectra, we believe that reading is the key to increasing the literacy levels of our students. Reading programme is a&nbsp;<b>weekly school-wide platform</b>&nbsp;where students and teachers read and participate in reading-related activities.</p>

<p align="justify">This whole-school approach towards reading supports students in developing positive reading habits and discovering books that are of interest to them based on their respective reading levels. Students have access to the&nbsp;Spectra Reading List&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;NLB Overdrive&nbsp;for an extensive collection of reading materials.</p>

<p align="justify">Our English Language department also actively promotes reading among the students through monthly reading engagement sessions where the students have opportunities to hear from their fellow schoolmates as well as their teachers on recommended reads.</p>

##### **Volunteer Reading Programme**

<p align="justify">Besides Literacy coaches who work with our lower secondary students, we also have experienced volunteers who are retired English Language teachers or parents to support our Secondary Three and Four students in small groups face-to-face. Our volunteers engage students in various reading and speaking activities to pique and further develop their confidence and interest in literacy.
</p>

<p align="justify">With greater confidence an stronger literacy skills, students are more motivated to work towards their academic goals not just in the English Language but also in other subjects. The weekly programme supports students throughout the academic year, including end-of-year examinations preparation.</p>

##### **Professional Development for Spectra Teachers**

<p align="justify">At Spectra, we believe that caring and skilful teachers are key in enabling students to build strong foundations in literacy and numeracy, sharpening their skills in vocational training and digital technology as well as nurturing independent and responsible citizens of good character.</p>

<p align="justify">We are committed to supporting our teachers in the continual development of competencies to respond to the changing and varied needs of our students.&nbsp;Professional development at Spectra focuses on three key domains: The Skillful Teacher, Certification Training in Special Needs, and e-Pedagogy.</p>

<p align="justify">Therefore, our teachers are able to foster stronger teacher-student relationships, and design and differentiate lessons through the use of digital technology and tiered approaches to tailor programmes for students with different learning needs.</p>
