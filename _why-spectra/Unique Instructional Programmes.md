##### **Garden-Based Service Learning (GBSL)**

Garden-based Service Learning (GBSL) is part of our enrichment curriculum where students get first-hand experience in growing edible plants from seed to harvest in our **Spectra Edible Learning Garden**. Students not only learn about values such as responsibility and resilience, they also gain greater awareness of environmental conservation and food sustainability.

Elements of English Language, Mathematics and Science are interwoven into the lessons and students also learn to engage the school community by organising a **Farmers’ Market** after each harvest.

The GBSL programme is not just about growing edible plants, it is also about inculcating values and enabling students to appreciate the importance of hard work and the efforts of people around us.

##### **Learning Through Immersive Play**

At Spectra, our students enjoy learning by working in teams to help each other solve problems together. Our teachers are constantly exploring new ways to provide exciting and engaging experiential learning opportunities to motivate students.

**Team-based learning** through immersive play is part of our Mathematics curriculum where students work together to uncover clues, solve problems and accomplish tasks in our very own customised **Spectra Escape Rooms**. Students gain motivation to further their learning and strengthen their skills in collaboration, communication and critical thinking through these experiences.

**Task-based learning through immersive technology** is part of our English Language curriculum where students use Google Earth to explore the world, share dream travel destinations and plan adventurous travel itineraries such as trekking at Mount Everest Base Camp. Such experiences also harness the interactivity and multimodal features of digital technologies to differentiate the nature of the content, learning processes and products of learning to meet the needs of our students.
