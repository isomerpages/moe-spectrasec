##### **Sustainable Agriculture**

<p align="justify">Sustainable Agriculture forms an integral part of our enriched curriculum, offering students an immersive learning experience in our Spectra Edible Learning Garden and Green Room. Through hands-on activities, they acquire knowledge and practical skills in sustainable agricultural practices, while actively participating in the conversion of organic food waste into nutrient-rich compost. This holistic approach not only fosters a deep understanding of environmental conservation and food sustainability, but also instills essential values such as responsibility and resilience within our students.</p>

##### **Learning Through Immersive Play and Technology**

<p align="justify">At Spectra, our students enjoy learning by working in teams to help each other solve problems together. Our teachers are constantly exploring new ways to provide exciting and engaging experiential learning opportunities to motivate students.</p>

<p align="justify"> Team-based learning through immersive play is part of our Mathematics curriculum where students work together to uncover clues, solve problems and accomplish tasks in our very own customised Spectra Escape Rooms. Students gain motivation to further their learning and strengthen their skills in collaboration, communication and critical thinking through these experiences.</p>

<p align="justify">Task-based learning through immersive technology is part of our English Language curriculum where students use Google Earth to explore the world, share dream travel destinations and plan adventurous travel itineraries. The interactivity and multimodal features of digital technologies help to differentiate the nature of content, learning processes and products of learning to meet the needs of our students.</p>
