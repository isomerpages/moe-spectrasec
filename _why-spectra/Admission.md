<p>Students are strongly encouraged to visit and apply directly at Spectra
to better understand the subjects offered and the progression pathways
after graduation from Primary School. You are welcome to visit us at our
upcoming Open House after the release of the PSLE results.</p>
<p>To optimize your chances to join Spectra, you can apply directly at Spectra
before participating in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise to opt for other
school choices.</p>

1 Posting Exercise.</p>

</p>
</td>

<p>Students who apply directly to SPECTRA will have their applications processed
by the schools. Any remaining vacancies thereafter will be set aside for
students to be posted to SPECTRA via S1 Posting.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Previously, SPECTRA only admits students via direct admission. This year,
SPECTRA will be able to take in additional students who are eligible for
Posting Group 1 and applied via S1 Posting. This allows SPECTRA to take
in more students, e.g., those who have missed the direct application.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>We would strongly encourage students to visit SPECTRA to better understand
the curriculum offered and the progression pathways after graduation. Students

<p><strong>3. How come there is no PSLE score range for SPECTRA? How do I decide whether to choose the school when there is no score range?</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>As SPECTRA processed the applications via direct admission in 2022 and
will continue to admit students via hybrid application modes from 2023
onwards, it would not be meaningful to display the PSLE score range like
other secondary schools where the PSLE score range is derived solely based
on Sec 1 Posting.</p>

<p><strong>4. I have applied directly to SPECTRA. Do I still need to take part in Sec 1 Posting to select other schools?</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Students who apply directly to SPECTRA must still participate in Sec 1
Posting to indicate other school choices. This is to ensure that they are
posted to a secondary school in case their application to SPECTRA is unsuccessful.</p>
</td>

<p>Students whose SPECTRA application is successful will be informed by the

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Students who are keen to be admitted into SPECTRA are encouraged to apply
to the school directly. If students had applied directly to the school,
