##### **Data Protection Policy**

**Introduction**

1\. The Singapore Personal Data Protection Act - 2012 (‘PDPA’) establishes a general data protection law in Singapore which governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations in a manner that recognises both the rights of individuals to protect their personal data and the need of organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.

2\. The purpose of this Data Protection Policy (DPP) is to inform individuals of how Crest Secondary School (‘the school’) manages personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“the Act”). This DPP supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consent you may have previously provided to the School. The School may from time to time update this protection policy to ensure that it is consistent with our future developments, and/or any changes in legal or regulatory requirements.

**Consent, Purpose Limitation and Notification Obligations**

3. Under this DPP, “Personal Data” refers to any data or information about an individual who can be identified either (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information to which the School has or is likely to have access.
