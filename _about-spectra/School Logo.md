Spectra in Latin means Spectrum and it encapsulates our philosophy of recognising the different strengths and talents of our students.

The School logo features a star that radiates a band of colours emanating from a single light source. The emerging colours symbolise the multiple streams of opportunities offered by the School. The radiating lines reflect the School’s recognition that each student’s learning progress will be different.

_Dusk Purple_ represents the School’s commitment to nurture our students to grow and shine. _Pink_ represents compassion, love and kindness, while _Green_ represents a vibrant and positive attitude towards life.

The angled lines converging towards the centre depict a strong community spirit resembling the _kampung_ or “village”, and a reminder that _“It takes a village to raise a child”._

In essence, it represents the School’s commitment to provide multiple platforms to help every student shine to the brightest of their potential.
