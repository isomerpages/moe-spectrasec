<p></p><p align="justify">Spectra in Latin means Spectrum and it encapsulates our philosophy of recognising the different strengths and talents of our students.

</p><p align="justify">The School logo features a star that radiates a band of colours emanating from a single light source. The emerging colours symbolise the multiple streams of opportunities offered by the School. The radiating lines reflect the School’s recognition that each student’s learning progress will be different.

</p><p align="justify"><b>Dusk Purple</b> represents the School’s commitment to nurture our students to grow and shine. <b>Pink</b> represents compassion, love and kindness, while <b>Green</b> represents a vibrant and positive attitude towards life.

</p><p align="justify">The angled lines converging towards the centre depict a strong community spirit resembling the kampung or “village”, and a reminder that <b>“It takes a village to raise a child”.</b>

</p><p align="justify">In essence, it represents the School’s commitment to provide multiple platforms to help every student shine to the brightest of their potential.</p>
