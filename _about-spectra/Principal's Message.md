<p align="justify"> Welcome to the pages of history as we celebrate Spectra Secondary School’s 10th Anniversary. </p>

<p align="justify">In 2013, a team of enthusiastic staff led by Principal Krishnan Aravinthan embarked on a pioneering mission with a vision to innovate, redefine education, and provide an inclusive learning environment for technically inclined students from diverse backgrounds. Ten years on, we continue to build upon the strong foundations laid by the pioneers with unwavering commitment.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the years, Spectra has enjoyed close partnerships with parents and industries to organise enrichment programmes and work attachments for our students. These collaborative partnerships have left an indelible impact in our students, and broadened their understanding of work and life. From industry giants to local champions, their invaluable support has transformed our students’ mindsets, turning barren grounds into fertile landscapes.</p>

<p align="justify">Our rooftop garden, once an empty canvas, now flourishes with life – akin to the countless hours of back-breaking work put in by staff to enable our students to bloom. Resilience is a hallmark of Spectra, and our staff, students and alumni exemplify this spirit. They have embraced adversity and turned it into a driving force for their success.</p>

<p align="justify">十年树木，百年树人 – It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to bring up a generation of good men. Our commitment to shaping lives, nurturing curious minds, fostering creativity, and achieving excellence remains steadfast. Spectra remains a beacon of hope and cocoon for transformation, preparing our students for a skills and values-based future. </p>

<p align="justify">This year, Spectra won the overall champions for the ignITE Skills Challenge for the first time. In another first for Spectra, Derinda Lim, Valedictorian and Spectran of the Year 2022, received the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew Award for All Round Excellence. While the glittering awards certainly added glamour to the School’s ten-year  achievements, there are also many other unsung student heroes that have blossomed under the watch and support of our most caring staff. To this end, we must thank every staff, past &amp; present, for making Spectra’s 10th Anniversary Celebrations especially meaningful.</p>

<p align="justify">As we mark this significant milestone, ‘Forward Singapore, Upward Spectra’ reminds us of our raison d’etre. Together, we will always strive to enrich and uplift more lives. Thank you to all who have contributed to the School’s incredible growth over the last ten years. As we embark on the journey into the next decade, we recommit ourselves to the vow to provide every Spectran with an engaged learning experience that will enable them to lead a most fulfilling life. Happy 10th Anniversary, Spectra!</p>

_Together We Can!_
