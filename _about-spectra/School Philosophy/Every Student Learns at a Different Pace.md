##### **Every student learns at a different pace**

<p align="justify">Our students come from diverse background and have different academic readiness to acquire the next level of knowledge. We do not expect nor think it is necessary to try and teach the same knowledge to the every student at any one time. Instead, we focus on allowing students to exercise self-help in the absence of their teacher using technology and at the same time ensuring that differentiated instruction is taking place.</p>

<p align="justify">We believe that making it possible for students to self-help is critical. The teacher’s attention is perhaps the most precious commodity in class and has to be shared according to the urgency of students’ needs. Alternatives to the teacher’s attention have to be made available so that every student can still move on with their learning to a large extent with minimal teacher attention. This helps reduce the amount of attention required in total and allows the teacher to give attention to those that need it the most.</p>

<p align="justify">We believe that the key to creating alternatives to the teacher’s attention lies in technology. In addition, technology also allows teachers to track the progress of every student, making it possible for them to intervene and implement differentiated instruction in class.</p>
