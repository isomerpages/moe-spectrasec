##### **Teaching Philosophy of Spectra**

Here in Spectra, we have&nbsp;two key beliefs that guide our teaching and learning.

* Every student wants to learn
* Every student learns at a different pace

***

##### **Every student wants to learn**

<p align="justify"> Every student wants to learn though they may vary in reasons for learning and in levels of motivation. We believe that if the school can give students purpose and relevance in their learning, make them feel competent and give them meaningful choice and autonomy, all students will learn.</p>

<p align="justify">We seek to create purpose in learning by making knowledge relevant to students. Through curriculum integration, we allow students to see how the knowledge they are acquiring is relevant to their future workplace, as well as create an immediate usage for it whenever possible.</p>

<p align="justify">We want our students to experience small successes which will motivate them to keep trying till they feel competent in whatever they do. We believe that this sense of competency will spur them to achieve the next level in their work.</p>

<p align="justify">We want to give students real choices that shape their learning as well as give them the freedom to manage their own learning. By allowing students to apply their knowledge in the context of their choice, we believe that it creates a sense of ownership in them, increasing interest and motivation levels as a result.</p>
